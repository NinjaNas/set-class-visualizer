# TUTORIAL:
#
# Play with a backing track and mark/outline the chord changes
# with forte numbers!
#
# You can resize this window in the bottom right corner
#
# There are 6 types of special symbols as follows: FT@[]#
#
# # denotes a comment, words after it are ignored for this line
#
# A complete and valid 'token' contains:
#
# F followed by a valid Forte Number in inversion notation
#
# T followed by a transposition (0-11) of the Forte Number
#
# @ followed by timestamp in milliseconds of the chord change
#
# [write anything here to be shown, and close with]
# Ex. keys to press, chord symbol, scale, forte number
#
# The program must be made up of only complete tokens
# No whitespace can follow the F, T, and @ symbols
# It must follow the same order as shown above
#
# There does not have a be a newline, its only there
# for readability
#
# The tokens do not have to be in order based on the timestamp,
# the parser will automatically sort the tokens
#
# You can create a empty program if you do not want the chords to
# change, then select a set from the graph
#
# All the default midi and txt data files are on GitHub

# Please, make a pull request if you want to add a new file
# Add attributions to the top of the txt data file

# CUSTOM PROGRAM:
#
# Create a custom program using the program select dropdown
# and select custom
# 
# Add a midi file from your local system
#
# Use the Add Set @ Time button to easily set the token based
# on the current selected set on the graph, the current
# transposition and the current timestamp in the midi
#
# Once done hit Parse Program, it will tell you if the 
# program is valid
# 
# If its not valid, it will provide an error message with 
# the reason and the line and character location of the error 
#
# Then, you can simply run it in the audio panel and play
# it in the Piano tab :)
#
# Check out the forte dictionary using the program select dropdown
# to find the most common forte to chord symbol translation!
